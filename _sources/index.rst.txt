snap_to_bucket
==========================================

This tool allows to move data from AWS snapshots to S3 buckets.

Installation
=======================

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -m pip install -U pipenv
    $ pipenv install -e .

Requirements
===============

#. The script needs to be running on an EC2 instance.

#. Minimum RAM 2 GB, recommend RAM > 6 GB.

#. The instance running the script must have IAM role attached with privileges
   to perform following operations:

    * List snapshot
    * Create volume
    * Attach volume
    * Delete volume
    * List S3 objects
    * Upload to S3
    * Download from S3

Sample IAM policy
====================

You can create an IAM role and attach following policy:

                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }

Disclaimer
=============

The tool works for snapshots with only one Linux partition. If there are more
than partition, only the first partition will be picked.

Similarly, only one partition will be created while restoring.

The script also does not encrypt your data explicitly. So, make sure the S3
bucket is secure enough and it is advisable to enable server-side encryption
with AES-256.

Options
==========

.. code-block::

    usage: snap_to_bucket [-h] [-v] -b BUCKET [--proxy PROXY] [--noproxy NOPROXY]
                          [-t TAG] [--type {standard,io1,gp2,sc1,st1}] [-m DIR]
                          [-d] [-r] [-k KEY] [--boot]

    snap_to_bucket is a simple tool based on boto3 to move snapshots to S3 buckets

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose         increase output verbosity (-vvv for more verbosity)
      -b BUCKET, --bucket BUCKET
                            S3 bucket to push snaps in
      --proxy PROXY         proxy to be used
      --noproxy NOPROXY     comma separated list of domains which do not require
                            proxy
      -t TAG, --tag TAG     tag on snapshots (defaults to snap-to-bucket)
      --type {standard,io1,gp2,sc1,st1}
                            volume type (defaults to gp2)
      -m DIR, --mount DIR   mount point for disks (defaults to /mnt/snaps)
      -d, --delete          delete snapshot after transfer (defaults to false)
      -r, --restore         restore a snapshot
      -k KEY, --key KEY     key of the snapshot to restore (required if restoring)
      --boot                was the snapshot a bootable volume?

    use delete with caution

See :ref:`migrate` for steps to migrate the EBS Snapshots to S3.

See :ref:`recovery` for steps to recover data from S3.

Files on S3
==============

The script will store snapshots with following structure in S3:
    ``snap/<snapshot-name>/<snapshot-id>-<%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S-%f>.tar``

The snaphost name gets spaces and ``/`` replaces as ``+`` and ``_`` respectively.

This section is controlled by ``get_key_for_upload()`` of ``S3Handler`` class.
